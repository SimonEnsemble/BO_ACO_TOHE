    next_node_candidates(robot, top)

build list of candiate nodes for the next hop, for a given robot, given its partial trail. finds all neighbors of current node (assumed to be last node in the current partial trail) that have not been traveled to _from this current node_ before. (ok for a robot to re-visit a node; may be necessary to get back...)

if at base, we have the option to never leave it => if at base, always = an option to stay. 

allows for overlap with other robots. in fact, does not even consider the trails of the other robots (possible improvement here?).
